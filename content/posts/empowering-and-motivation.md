What motivates engineers
------------------------

To quote Bryan Cantrill:

> "[Engineers] want to solve hard, commercially relevant problems, with people
> that inspire us, achieving a mission that we believe in."
 - [Surge 2013 Speaker: Bryan Cantrill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KeYzjILqDo)

One would we be tempted to think that giving the best best practices, best
design choices and making the smartest choices would be the way to go to
inspire others. But to be really inspirational you actually need to do the
exact opposite: empowering people to choose *their* best practices, make
*their* design choices and above everything: don't think for a single second
that your choices are the smartest ones, let the people decide what is the
smart thing to do. It's your team who needs to feel smart, not you.

Of course sharing your own experience as a software engineer is always useful
but you need to resist the urge to decide for your team. Let the team decide,
let it fail if necessary, so it can learn and get better.

What happens when you don't empower your team?
----------------------------------------------

If the people who work on the project cannot take decision, they lose ownership
on the code. Losing ownership will eventually lead to a lost of motivation and
maybe to losing your entire team one by one. There is so much competition in
the IT industry that you need to give people good reasons to stay, and code
ownership is one of those. When your team feels like they are empowered to take
the decisions, they feel impactful, useful and most importantly: they feel like
they are part of the company.

Postmortems and growth
----------------------

> "The way we should scale is by finding the fewest number of the best software
> engineers."
 - [Surge 2013 Speaker: Bryan Cantrill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KeYzjILqDo)

You can't really find the best software engineers by improving the technical
interview. You need to create the talented engineers that you seek. Highly
motivated people are capable to learn and improve much more faster than
average.

As we are all learning from our mistakes, your team (including you) is going to
learn a lot also from their mistakes. That is why doing a blameless postmortem
right after an incident can be very important to the growth of your team in
term of experience.

If it's safe to try, just do it
-------------------------------

Never leave anyone in your team helpless with the impression that their ideas
will never be tested. Always go for it if you can. My own personal gold rule
is: if it's safe to try, let's do it. Either the result will be good, or it
will be an experience.
