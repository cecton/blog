What motivates engineers
------------------------

Recently I have come to realize that there are plenty of great engineers
everywhere, but most of them are not allowed to shine in their job because of
bad (or missing) company culture, wrong interview process, bad management,
etc... In order to create a team of talented people, I believe you need to
create a great company culture by: empowering them and allowing them to grow.
Highly motivated people are capable to learn and improve much more faster than
average.

One would be tempted to think that giving the best best practices, best
design choices and making the smartest choices would be the way to go to
inspire others. But to be really inspirational you actually need to do the
exact opposite: empowering people to choose **their** best practices, make
**their** design choices and above everything else: don't think for a single
second that your choices are the smartest ones, let the people decide what is
the smart thing to do. It's your team who needs to feel smart, not you.

Of course sharing your own experience as a software engineer is always useful
but you need to resist the urge to decide for your team. Let the team decide,
let it fail if necessary, so it can learn and get better (or you can learn and
get better).

Never leave anyone in your team helpless with the impression that their ideas
will never be tested. Always go for it if you can. My own personal gold rule
is: if it's safe to try, let's do it. Either the result will be good, or it
will be an experience.

Postmortems and growth
----------------------

As we are all learning from our mistakes, your team (including you) is going to
learn a lot also from their mistakes. That is why doing a blameless postmortem
right after an incident can be very important to the growth of your team in
term of experience.

In order to make the communication smooth and constructive, you also need to
set up a few rules to avoid clashes between the team members. For example, it
is a risk to allow strong opinions to be loosely held.

What happens when you don't empower your team
---------------------------------------------

If the people who work on the project cannot take decision, they lose ownership
on the code. Losing ownership will eventually lead to a lost of motivation and
maybe to losing your entire team one by one. There is so much competition in
the IT industry that you need to give people good reasons to stay, and code
ownership is one of those. When your team feels like they are empowered to take
the decisions, they feel impactful, useful and most importantly: they feel like
they are part of the company.
